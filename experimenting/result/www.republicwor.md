Pahalgam Terror Attack: Crucial Meeting at PM Modi's Residence; Defence Minister, NSA, CDS and AAF Chiefs Present | Image: X
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a high-level meeting attended by key officials, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, and Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh.
The meeting followed a previous discussion between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and PM Modi on Monday at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. The talks came just one day after Gen Anil Chauhan briefed Rajnath Singh on developments concerning the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed 26 lives.
In response to the attack, the government has vowed severe punishment for the terrorists and their masterminds. An all-party meeting was also convened to discuss the incident, with opposition parties expressing full support for any action taken against the attackers.
The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) met the day after the attack, during which the cross-border connections of the assault were highlighted. The meeting underscored that this attack occurred following successful elections in Jammu and Kashmir and the region's continued progress towards economic development.
To send a strong message to Pakistan for its alleged support of cross-border terrorism, the government announced a series of measures, including putting the Indus Water Treaty on hold.
During the night of April 28–29, 2025, the Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked small arms firing across the Line of Control (LoC) in the Kupwara, Baramulla, and Akhnoor sectors, marking the fifth consecutive day of ceasefire violations. Indian Army posts were specifically targeted, and the Indian Army responded with measured and effective retaliation, maintaining operational restraint.
On the diplomatic front, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss key security measures following the recent Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which resulted in 26 deaths, including one Nepalese national. This meeting followed an all-party consultation chaired by Singh to address the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
In response to the attack, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was deployed to gather evidence, while the Indian Army conducted extensive search operations. Meanwhile, the Indian government announced the withdrawal of Defence, Navy, and Air Advisors from the High Commission in Islamabad, effectively ending military representation in Pakistan.
The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) strongly condemned the attack, expressed condolences to the victims' families, and highlighted potential cross-border involvement, considering the region’s recent peaceful elections and economic progress.

## CBI to Probe Major 'Builder-Bank Nexus' After Homebuyers Forced to Pay EMIs Without Getting Flats
The Supreme Court has directed the CBI to register and conduct multiple preliminary inquiries into an alleged “builder-bank nexus”, based on a plea filed by a large number of homebuyers who claimed they were forced to pay EMIs despite not receiving possession of their flats due to delays by developers.
A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N. Kotiswar Singh ordered the CBI to conduct preliminary inquiries in relation to the projects launched by M/s Supertech Limited in the Delhi NCR region and to conduct the same over projects by other builders outside the Delhi NCR region.
Issues were also raised by homebuyers regarding the subvention scheme, under which banks sanction loans to homebuyers, but the EMIs against those loans are to be paid by the builders as per a tripartite agreement. However, when builders defaulted on these payments, banks initiated recovery proceedings against the homebuyers, the homebuyers have alleged.
