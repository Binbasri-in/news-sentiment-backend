Pahalgam Terror Attack: Tourists Trapped As Terrorists Blocked Entry And Exit Points Before Firing Began | 
**Pahalgam:** The terror attack in Pahalgamâ€™s scenic Baisaran Valley has not only claimed 26 lives but also exposed a chilling shift in strategy by Pakistan-based militant groups, investigative sources reveal. Survivor testimonies and early probe findings suggest that the attack was pre-planned to trap tourists with no route to escape, turning a peaceful picnic spot in Jammu and Kashmir into a death trap.
**A Coordinated Entrapment**
As per reports from India Today, the attack was carried out by at least three terrorists, possibly four. The attack on the tourists was executed with brutal coordination. According to statements recorded by investigating agencies, the attackers blocked both entry and exit points of the valley. This ensured maximum chaos and confusion, leaving tourists, including families with children, cornered and defenseless.
Two attackers, wearing military uniforms, reportedly entered from the main gate, while another terrorist who was dressed in a traditional Kashmiri pheran, stationed himself at the exit gate. Preliminary evidence also suggests a fourth individual may have been providing support from within the nearby forest area. He was either monitoring movement or facilitating escape.
**Survivors Describe Terrifying Ordeal**
Eyewitnesses described a scene of terror as gunfire first erupted at the exit gate, forcing panicked visitors to rush back toward the entrance, only to be met by two gunmen already waiting. In a harrowing twist, the terrorists reportedly tried to divide the crowd by religion, they also asked the tourists to recite the Islamic verses or Kalma.
Among the first victims was Navy officer Lt. Vinay Narwal, who had entered the valley moments before the attack began. The most casualties occurred around a tea and snack stall area, where large groups had gathered to eat and rest.
**NIA Probes Attack Route & Digital Trail**
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has launched an intensive probe. A team of six officers, including forensic experts, has reached the site to reconstruct the sequence of events. The suspected escape route through the forest is being videographed and terrain data is being analysed to understand how the attackers may have fled.
Investigators believe that the terrorists used encrypted communication apps possibly on paid mobile platforms to stay in touch with their handlers in Pakistan. A zipline operator, seen in a video during the attack, is among the locals being questioned along with pony operators and shopkeepers from the valley.
**Security Forces on High Alert**
As security forces widen combing operations across south Kashmir, officials fear this style of attack, combining psychological tactics, religious intimidation and controlled entrapment, may signal a new phase of militant operations targeting civilians.

Sources say intelligence agencies are now re-examining security protocols at popular tourist destinations, especially those with limited access points.
This attack not only marks a brutal loss of life but also a troubling reminder that terror groups continue to innovate their methods, even as the region tries to revive tourism and peace.
